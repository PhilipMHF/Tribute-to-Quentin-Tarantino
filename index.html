        <h2>Who is Tarantino?</h2>
        <p>
          Either an individual grasps Quentin Tarantino’s films, or doesn’t.
          Those who do understand his movies, relate to his craft of making a
          daring fusion of thrillers, neo-noir, and non-linear films. Those who
          do not apprehend his films, pass them off as mere art-house cinema
          material. Nonetheless, Quentin Tarantino has grown to become one of
          the biggest names in Hollywood. Not only has he managed to gather a
          cult following for his films, he, unlike his previous generation of
          filmmakers, has understood in entirety, what ‘kind’ of films get the
          audiences flocking to cinema halls. From the famous Pulp Fiction to
          Inglorious Basterds and Reservoir Dogs to Natural Born Killers, he has
          come a long way from working in a video rental store to one of the
          most legendary director-screenwriters of all time. Through most part
          of his life, he juggled as the multifaceted actor, director,
          screenwriter and producer and in the latter part of his life, decided
          to stick to doing what he knew best - direction and production. One
          would be able to spot a Quentin Tarantino classic from a mile away.
          His films are pregnant with dissimilar traditions, gangster violence,
          Blaxploitation themes and accented language.

        <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963 in Knoxville,
              Tennessee, United States, to Tony Tarantino, an actor and Connie
              McHugh, a nurse. He is of Italian-Irish-Cherokee ancestry. He was
              raised by his mother and stepfather, Curt Zastoupil.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              He studied at Fleming Junior High School, where he took up drama
              classes and also studied at Narbonne High School, before he
              dropped out at the age of 15.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After he quit school, he attended James Best Theater Company but
              left it after two years.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              He began working as an employee in the video rental store, ‘Video
              Archives’. He began to discuss movies at length with his
              colleagues and other customers who would come to rent films. It is
              believed that during this time, he was exposed to Blaxploitation
              films and also paid close attention to the type of movies that
              customers preferred to rent/purchase.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Quentin Tarantino met Lawrence Bender at a party. The latter
              encouraged him to write his first screenplay, which he did and
              called it My Best Friend’s Birthday. However, the reel of the film
              was destroyed in a fire and the screenplay would go on to form the
              basis for True Romance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              He debuted as a director with the film, Reservoir Dogs, which
              released in 1992. The film became an instant hit and was screened
              at the Sundance Film Festival the same year.
            </p>
          </li>

              movie, True Romance starring Van Kilmer, Christian Slater and Gary
              Oldman. The following year, he wrote the screenplay for Natural
              Born Killers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              He had become so popular in Hollywood by now that many
              scriptwriters approached him for films like Speed and Men in
              Black. But he refused the scripts, withdrew to Amsterdam and began
              working on his next big project, Pulp Fiction.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In 1994, Pulp Fiction was released and received numerous awards
              for its ingenious direction and non-linear story line. It became
              so popular that he was nominated for the category of Best Director
              for the Academy Awards.

              Blaxploitation film, ‘Jackie Brown’, which was an adaptation of
              the novel, ‘Rum Punch’.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the new millennium, he directed the hit feature, ‘Kill Bill:
              Vol.1’ starring Uma Thurman, in 2003. The movie was so successful

            </p>
          </li>
